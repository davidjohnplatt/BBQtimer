BBQ timer app written in Javascript so it runs on a phone

BBQing is boring.  I usually read while it is going on and
often lose track of the process.  This app will (eventually) provide
an audible reminder when things need to be done.  

Select the time you want to BBQ for.  I use 12 minutes for example 
on hamburgers.  When you add the hamburger to the grill press the start
button.  After the the time is down to 0 flip the burger and press the 
flip button.  If it doesn't look right the extra time window will 
keep track of how much extra time you use.
